Getting Started
===============

Install Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before we begin, if you haven't already done so, you may wish to check that
you have all the :doc:`prereqs` installed on the platform(s)
on which you'll be developing blockchain applications and/or operating
Hyperledger Fabric.

Install Binaries and Docker Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While we work on developing real installers for the Hyperledger Fabric
binaries, we provide a script that will :ref:`binaries` to your system.
The script also will download the Docker images to your local registry.

Hyperledger Fabric Samples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We offer a set of sample applications that you may wish to install these
:doc:`samples` before starting with the tutorials as the tutorials leverage
the sample code.

Tutorials
^^^^^^^^^

We offer four initial tutorials to get you started with Hyperledger Fabric.
The first is oriented to the Hyperledger Fabric **application developer**,
:doc:`write_first_app`. It takes you through the process of writing your first
blockchain application for Hyperledger Fabric using the Hyperledger Fabric
`Node SDK <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node>`__.

The second tutorial is oriented towards the Hyperledger Fabric network
operators, :doc:`build_network`. This one walks you through the process of
establishing a blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric and provides
a basic sample application to test it out.

Finally, we offer two chaincode tutorials. One oriented to developers,
:doc:`chaincode4ade`, and the other oriented to operators,
:doc:`chaincode4noah`.
