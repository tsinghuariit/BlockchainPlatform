Prerequisites
=============

Install cURL
------------

Download the `cURL <https://curl.haxx.se/download.html>`__ tool if not
already installed.

.. note:: If you're on Windows please see the specific note on `Windows
   extras`_ below.

Docker and Docker Compose
-------------------------

You will need the following installed on the platform on which you will be
operating, or developing on (or for), Hyperledger Fabric:

  - MacOSX, *nix, or Windows 10: `Docker <https://www.docker.com/products/overview>`__
    v1.12 or greater is required.
  - Older versions of Windows: `Docker
    Toolbox <https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/>`__ -
    again, Docker version v1.12 or greater is required.

You can check the version of Docker you have installed with the following
command from a terminal prompt:

.. code:: bash

  docker --version

.. note:: Installing Docker for Mac or Windows, or Docker Toolbox will also
          install Docker Compose. If you already had Docker installed, you
          should check that you have Docker Compose version 1.8 or greater
          installed. If not, we recommend that you install a more recent
          version of Docker.

You can check the version of Docker Compose you have installed with the
following command from a terminal prompt:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose --version

.. _Golang:

Go Programming Language
-----------------------

Hyperledger Fabric uses the Go programming language 1.7.x for many of its
components.

.. note: Go version 1.8.x will yield test failures

  - `Go <https://golang.org/>`__ - version 1.7.x

Given that we are writing a Go chaincode program, we need to be sure that the
source code is located somewhere within the ``$GOPATH`` tree. First, you will
need to check that you have set your ``$GOPATH`` environment variable.

.. code:: bash
  echo $GOPATH
  /Users/xxx/go

If nothing is displayed when you echo ``$GOPATH``, you will need to set it.
Typically, the value will be a directory tree child of your development
workspace, if you have one, or as a child of your $HOME directory. Since we'll
be doing a bunch of coding in Go, you might want to add the following to your
``~/.bashrc``:

.. code:: bash

  export GOPATH=$HOME/go
  export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

Node.js Runtime and NPM
-----------------------

If you will be developing applications for Hyperledger Fabric leveraging the
Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Node.js, you will need to have version 6.9.x of Node.js
installed.

.. note:: Node.js version 7.x is not supported at this time.

  - `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`__ - version 6.9.x or greater

.. note:: Installing Node.js will also install NPM, however it is recommended
          that you update the default version of NPM installed. You can upgrade
          the ``npm`` tool with the following command:

.. code:: bash

  npm install npm@latest -g

Windows extras
--------------

If you are developing on Windows, you may also need the following which
provides a better alternative to the built-in Windows tools:

  - `Git Bash <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`__

.. note:: On older versions of Windows, such as Windows 7, you
          typically get this as part of installing Docker
          Toolbox. However experience has shown this to be a poor
          development environment with limited functionality. It is
          suitable to run Docker based scenarios, such as
          :doc:`getting_started`, but you may not be able to find a
          suitable ``make`` command.

.. note:: The ``curl`` command that comes with Git and Docker Toolbox
          is old and does not handle properly the redirect used in
          :doc:`getting_started`. Make sure you install and use a
          newer version from the `cURL downloads page
          <https://curl.haxx.se/download.html>`__
